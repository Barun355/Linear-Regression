Desc :- Currently I am pursuing Machine Learning by self study with free online resources available. It's not an easy task but I am trying to destifying ML to my self through thousands of free online resourse available.This is my journey and first step to CS field.I have tried to build a simple linear regression model using one of the most useful libraries on python for machine learning Numpy. And use some most likely modules to train this model to predict the salary of the person based on years of experience they have. And the dataset I have used is of 30 data points which I have taken from one the youtube channel named Siddharthan. And this project is also inspired by his one of the video playlist of Machine Learning (Building Regression model from scratch).
